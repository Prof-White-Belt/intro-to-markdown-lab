Making the pasta may seem simple, however it is an art, there are a few key steps to ensure your pasta is cooked just right. Here's a step by step tutorial to making the perfect pasta from start to finish.

## Step 1: Choose Your Pasta

Choosing the right type of pasta is important. Different types of pasta are better for different kinds of sauces. For example:
- **Spaghetti**: Best for tomato-based or creamy sauces.
- **Penne**: Great for chunky sauces and baked dishes.
- **Fettuccine**: Perfect for rich, creamy sauces like Alfredo.

## Step 2: Boil the Water

Start by bringing a large pot of water to a boil. A good rule is to use about 5 cups of water for every pound of pasta.

### Tip:
Add **salt** to the water once it's boiling. This will help season the pasta and give it more flavor. About 1-2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water is key.

## Step 3: Add the Pasta

Once your water is boiling, add the pasta. Stir immediately to prevent the pasta from sticking together and sticking to the bottom of your pot.

### Tip:
Don't you dare break the pasta in half! Just stir it gently to ensure it stays submerged.

## Step 4: Cook the Pasta

Most pasta takes around 8-12 minutes to cook, depending on the type and how much pasta you added. For the best texture, aim for **al dente**—which means the pasta is tender but still slightly firm.

### Tip:
Check the pasta a minute or two before the recommended time to ensure it's not overcooked.

## Step 5: Drain and Reserve Some Pasta Water

Once your pasta is done, **drain it**, but make sure to save a cup of the pasta water. The starch from the water can be used to adjust the thickness of your sauce later on.

### Tip:
Don’t rinse the pasta! Rinsing removes the starch, which helps the sauce stick better.

## Step 6: Combine with Sauce

Now it’s time to combine your pasta with your sauce! Add the drained pasta to your sauce, then stir gently. If needed, add a little of the saved pasta water to the sauce to make it creamier.

### Tip:
For a richer flavor, let the pasta simmer in the sauce for 1-2 minutes so the pasta absorbs the sauce.

## Step 7: Add Cheese and Garnish

Top your pasta with freshly grated **Parmesan cheese**, chopped **fresh basil**, or a sprinkle of **crushed red pepper flakes** for added flavor.
